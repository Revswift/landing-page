                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using RevSwift (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use the Service.</p>
                <p>RevSwift is operated by Mrs. Efe Joyce Osunbor ("we," "us," or "our") and provides an AI-driven operating system for SME revenue growth using the proprietary S.M.E.V.I.S.A.F. execution model.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Nature of Advisory Service</h2>
                <p><strong>Algorithmic Recommendations, Not Financial Advice:</strong> RevSwift provides algorithmic recommendations based on the Channel Viability Score (CVS) and Action Priority Score (APS) models. These recommendations include specific actions such as "Double down here," "Pause this," or "Do not execute."</p>
                <p><strong>No Guarantee of Results:</strong> While the Service is designed to improve marketing ROI and reduce budget waste, RevSwift does not guarantee specific revenue figures, business growth, or marketing outcomes. Results depend on multiple factors including market conditions, execution quality, and business fundamentals.</p>
                <p><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You assume full responsibility for the final decision to execute marketing spend based on the platform's suggestions. RevSwift is a decision support tool, not a substitute for business judgment.</p>
                <p><strong>Not Financial or Investment Advice:</strong> RevSwift does not provide financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Consult qualified professionals for such matters.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Intellectual Property & Proprietary Rights</h2>
                <p><strong>Ownership:</strong> The S.M.E.V.I.S.A.F. execution model, scoring algorithms (Execution Readiness Score, Channel Viability Score, Action Priority Score), and all related methodologies are proprietary intellectual property owned by Mrs. Efe Joyce Osunbor.</p>
                <p><strong>Trade Secrets:</strong> The scoring logic, decision-making algorithms, and strategic frameworks constitute trade secrets and confidential business information.</p>
                <p><strong>Prohibited Activities:</strong> You may not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Service</li>
                    <li>Use the "Reality Audit" or "Strategy Builder" outputs to build a competing service</li>
                    <li>Extract, scrape, or systematically collect data from the platform</li>
                    <li>Copy, reproduce, or redistribute the proprietary methodologies</li>
                    <li>Attempt to discover the underlying algorithms or scoring models</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>License Grant:</strong> We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for your internal business purposes only, subject to these Terms.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. User Data Accuracy</h2>
                <p><strong>Garbage In, Garbage Out:</strong> RevSwift's recommendations are only as accurate as the data you provide. The Service relies on your "Situation Analysis" (Reality Audit) including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Revenue goals and financial capacity</li>
                    <li>Marketing budget limits and historical spend</li>
                    <li>Current technology stack and integrations</li>
                    <li>Sales process data and conversion rates</li>
                    <li>Resource constraints and team capacity</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and truthfulness of all data entered into the Service.</p>
                <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> RevSwift is not liable for "Low Viability" recommendations, "High Risk" warnings, or suboptimal strategies that result from false, incomplete, or inaccurate data provided during onboarding or ongoing use.</p>
                <p>If your Execution Readiness Score (ERS) is low due to inaccurate data entry, you cannot hold RevSwift responsible for restricted access to execution features.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Third-Party Orchestration & API Liability</h2>
                <p><strong>Aggregator Role:</strong> RevSwift acts as a "System Orchestrator," connecting to and controlling external platforms including:</p>

                    <li>Google Ads and Google Analytics</li>
                    <li>Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads Manager</li>
                    <li>CRM platforms (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)</li>
                    <li>Email marketing tools (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign)</li>
                    <li>Other marketing and analytics platforms</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>No Liability for Third-Party Services:</strong> RevSwift is not responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uptime, availability, or performance of third-party platforms</li>
                    <li>Changes to third-party APIs that break integrations</li>
                    <li>Data policies or terms of service of connected platforms</li>
                    <li>Billing, charges, or account issues with external services</li>
                    <li>Data loss or corruption on third-party platforms</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Account Ownership:</strong> You retain full ownership of your connected accounts (e.g., Google Ads, HubSpot). By connecting these accounts, you grant RevSwift a license to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read performance data and metrics</li>
                    <li>Write data to execute approved actions (e.g., pausing campaigns)</li>

                    <li>Access historical data for analysis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may revoke this access at any time by disconnecting the integration, though this will limit the Service's functionality.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Data Migration & Upload Risks</h2>
                <p><strong>Migration Services:</strong> RevSwift allows you to migrate data from previous tools via CSV uploads, screenshots, or bulk imports.</p>
                <p><strong>User Risk:</strong> While we implement security measures, you bear the risk of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data loss or corruption during migration</li>
                    <li>Incomplete or inaccurate data transfer</li>
                    <li>Formatting issues that affect data integrity</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Not a Backup Service:</strong> RevSwift is not a backup or archival service for your historical legacy data. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Validation:</strong> You must verify the accuracy of migrated data before relying on it for strategic decisions.</p>

                </ul>
